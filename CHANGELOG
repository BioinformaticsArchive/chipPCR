Changes from Version 0.0.6 to 0.0.7 [June 26 2014]
* From S3 to S4
* Many bug fixes
* Code optimized for speed and less memory usage
* Improved some examples
* New function MFIaggr and class refMFI
* New function effcalc
* amptester 
    - flexible head and tail now
    - nonlinearity test to detect positive amplifications
    - t.test exchanged by wilcox.test to compare levels of head and tail 
      region
    - tests for noise (based on Shapiro-Wilk test) and linearity
* smoother has now support for weighted Whittaker smoother
* CPP has further normalization methods
* CPP has new regression methods (rank-based estimation models, 
  quantile regression)
* CPP argument "minmax" detracted and substituted by more powerful
  method "norm"
* Smoother argument "spline" as parameter for internal fixNA detracted. 
  Uses
  splines in fixNA exclusively
* Added methods to fixNA
* NOTE: new naming convention in inder
* bg.max
      - uses inder method by default now
      - better tests for estimated start and end of exponential 
	amplification region	
* Added rounder function for rounding results of inder
* New data set added
* testxy function added for unformalized testing of x and y values
* Added methods for CPP, inder, bg.max and effcalc
* Added amptest, der and bg classes.
* Assorted improvements to AmpSim
* Added AmpSim.gui
* Many updates and correction to descriptions in manual
* New data sets
