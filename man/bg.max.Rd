\title{
Simple function to detect and correct the background range
}
\description{
The function \code{\link[chipPCR]{bg.max}} is intended to detect and 
correct background noise. The detection is made without any assumptions 
regarding the model of the function.
}
\usage{
\S4method{bg.max}{numeric,numeric}(x, y, bg.corr = 1.3, bg.start = 1, 
		  inder.approx = TRUE)

\S4method{bg.max}{matrix,missing}(x, y, bg.corr = 1.3, bg.start = 1, 
		  inder.approx = TRUE)

\S4method{bg.max}{data.frame,missing}(x, y, bg.corr = 1.3, bg.start = 1, 
		  inder.approx = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    is a vector containing the time or cycle values or data frame/matrix 
containing cycle in the first column and fluorescence values in the second 
column. 
}
  \item{y}{
    is a vector containing the fluorescence values. Used only if \code{x} 
is also a vector. 
}
  \item{bg.corr}{
  	a value which helps to tweak on the suggested background value of 
    \code{\link[chipPCR]{bg.max}}.
}
  \item{bg.start}{
	  a user defined value for the start of the background range.
}
  \item{inder.approx}{
    a \code{logical} value defining if data should be numerically derived 
by \code{\link[chipPCR]{inder}} function. If \code{FALSE}, derivative is 
calculated by the finite difference method.
}

\details{
Background range herein refers to a level of fluorescence measured before 
any specific amplification is detectable. The raw data (e.g., fluorescence 
intensity) measured after each step (cycle or time point) follow a 
non-linear progress. The background is assumed to be constant for the 
entire measurement. The algorithm of \code{\link[chipPCR]{bg.max}} is based 
on the assumption that the signal difference of successive cycles in the 
linear ground phase is approximately constant. After transition in the 
early exponential phase the signal changes drastically. First data are 
smoothed by Friedman's 'super smoother' (as found in 
\code{\link[stats]{supsmu}}. Thereof the approximate 1st (FD) and 2nd (FD2) 
derivative are calculated by a five-point stencil \code{link{inder}}. 

The difference of cycles at the maxima of the 1st and 2nd approximate 
derivative and a correction factor are used to estimate the range before 
the exponential phase. This simple function finds the background range 
without modeling the function. The start of the background range is defined 
be a fixed value. Since many signals tend to overshot in the first cycles a 
default value of 3 is chosen. \code{\link[chipPCR]{bg.max}} tries also to 
estimate the end of an amplification reaction. This feature however is 
experimental.
