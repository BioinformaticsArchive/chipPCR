Threshold Cycle
}
\description{
\code{th.cyc} is a function to calculate the number of cycles at which the 
fluorescence exceeds a defined threshold, called the threshold cycle (Ct). 
According to the MIQE guidelines the Ct is referred to as quantification 
cycle (Cq). The calculated Cq is a relative value, which depends on the 
template copy number, instrument, reagents, amplification efficiency and 
probe technology. Low Cqs correlate with high quantities template copy 
numbers. Real-time technologies enable the quantification of nucleic acids 
by calculation of specific curve parameters like the quantification point 
(Cq) and the amplification efficiency (AE) based on the kinetics of the 
amplification curve. The Cq represents the number of cycles (time for qIA) 
needed to reach a defined fluorescence signal level in the exponential 
phase of the amplification curve. The Cq can be determined from a fixed 
threshold value or by various analytical algorithm as described elsewhere 
(Bustin et al. 2009, Ruijter et al. 2013, Tellinghuisen et al. 2014).

\usage{
th.cyc(x, y, r = 2500, auto = FALSE, linear = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  is a vector containing the time or cycle values or a matrix or data frame
    containing both time or cycle values and fluorescence.
}
  \item{y}{
    is a vector containing the fluorescence values.
}
  \item{r}{
    a fluorescence value which defines the threshold.
}
  \item{auto}{
    is logical parameter which indicates if an automatic estimation of the 
threshold should be used (Note: Experimental, not save to use).
}
  \item{linear}{
    is logical parameter which indicates if a linear of quadratic regression 
    should be used for the calculation. (Note: Experimental, not save to use).

\details{
The Threshold Cycle (Ct) (Cq according to MIQE, see Bustin et al. 2009) is 
the cycle number at which the fluorescence exceeds significantly a point 
above the baseline and defined threshold in a particular samples. Thus the 
Ct is the cycle when sufficient numbers of amplicons have accumulated. The 
\code{th.cyc} calculates the intersection of the user defined Ct value 
(\code{r}) and a linear regression or quadratic polynomial in the range of 
the user defined Ct value. In contrast to other methods is does 
\code{th.cyc} have no requirement to fit a "complex" non linear model to 
the entire data set but rather focuses on the specific area. The polynomial 
is calculated from four neighbor values at the fluorescence threshold.
